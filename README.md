RebalanceCalc is a simple web app built using React, Redux, and the Bootstrap UI framework.

## Cool features:
* The site automatically persists every change to the URL, making it easy to save, share, and restore your work

## Feel free to self-host!
* Dependencies
    * `nodejs`
        * Any relatively new release should work (the current LTS release is a solid choice)
        * Install from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or [via a package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).
* Steps:
    1. Download the source from this repo, or `git clone` the repo
    1. Open a terminal or powershell session in the root folder of your copy of this repo
    1. Run `npm install`
    1. Run `npm dev`
        * This builds the source code, bundles it, and starts a server
        * The app should be available at http://localhost:1234 while npm dev runs
        * Pressing `ctrl` + `c` or closing the terminal should kill the dev server

## Using a previous version:
