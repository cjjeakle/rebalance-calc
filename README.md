# rebalance-calc
A tool to help with rebalancing one's investment portfolio

View the live site: www.rebalancecalc.com

RebalanceCalc is a simple web app built using knockoutjs, skeleton, and jQuery.

## Cool features:

* This site is entirely client-side, so one can [download](https://github.com/cjjeakle/rebalance-calc/archive/master.zip) the source zip from github and run rebalance calc entirely offline (even saving works!)
* The save button generates a URL containing any data entered, making it easy to save, share, and restore work via a simple link or bookmark
